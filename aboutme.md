Hello! I'm Brandon Bruce; a Data Scientist. I've been programming for a few years. I've done some Java in the past,
but I am most fluent in Python. I've attended and completed the Data Science curriculum at Lambda School, where I 
was taught most of my python knowledge and even some SQL. I've got experience working in a local environment, with
groups, and gitbash. Here on my website, I'll show you several of the projects I have worked on in the past!
