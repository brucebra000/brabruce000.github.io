subtitle: Bloom Institute of Technology Graduate / Data Scientist / Unity Programmer
---

  Hello! I'm Brandon Bruce; a programmer! I've been programming for a few years. I've done some Java in the past,
but I am most fluent in Python and C#. I've attended and completed the Data Science curriculum at the Bloom Institute of Technology 
(formally known as Lambda School), where I was taught most of my python knowledge and even some SQL. 
I have also completed the core learning pathways at Unity Learn and have been doing independant work in Unity. I've got experience
working in a local environment, with groups, and gitbash. Here, on my website, I'll show you several of the projects I have worked on!
