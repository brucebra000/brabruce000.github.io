# What is Radical Ride?

Radical Ride is an endless runner type of game. This game was a lab project I've made when going though the
["Junior Programmer: Create with code 2"](https://learn.unity.com/mission/programming-simple-functionality?pathwayId=5f7e17e1edbc2a5ec21a20af) learning course on [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/).

# How to play

You can play the game in your browser at [Unity Play](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/radical-ride-1).
The game is an endless runner, which means that the game will keep going until the player messes up. You are a driving a motorscooter down a city road and are
trying to avoid obstacles along your path. If you crash into one, it's game over! Just use the "A" and "D" keys to steer.

Your only goal is to set a high score. To get points, you need to collect the stars along the road. Each star is worth one point.

Try to set the highest score you can!
