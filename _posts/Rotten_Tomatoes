I've created a machine that will try to predict a movie's critic rating will be classified as _Certified Fresh_, _Fresh_, or _Rotten_
on the website [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/).

The dataset that was used for this project was posted by [Stefano Leone](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992)
and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critics-datasets).
